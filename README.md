# ProceduralProject
This is a project that I did for my Programming methodologies class. The goal of the project was to create software the could be used by a fictional production facility that makes media players. This software would be primarily used to track the products that are produced and store that information. Other features of this software are the ability to add products that can be produced, add employee accounts, log into accounts, and see various information about what has been produced. Future features that I would like to add are the ability to remove products that can be produced, limiting who can use certain features based on who is logged in, and the ability to see more production information.
