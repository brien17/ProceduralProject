# Procedural Project
This is a project that I did for my Programming methodologies class. The goal of the project was to create software the could be used by a fictional production facility that makes media players. This software would be primarily used to track the products that are produced and store that information. Other features of this software are the ability to add and remove products that can be produced, add employee accounts, log into accounts, and see various information about what has been produced. This project was made in my sophmore year as an FGCU student studying software engineering. This was made over a 6 week long summer course and is my first time using C++. This project was made in the procedural style to learn the concepts of procedural programing.

## Demonstration

## Documentation
The program was documented using Doxygen style comments, as they are the standard for c++.
